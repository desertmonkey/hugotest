Cumulus® NetQ is a network operations tool set that provides actionable insight into and operational intelligence about the health of the entire Linux-based data center — from the container, virtual machine, or host, all the way to the switch and port. Working hand-in-hand with Cumulus Linux, NetQ enables organizations to validate network state, both during regular operations and for post-mortem diagnostic analysis. Running on Cumulus Linux switches and other certified systems — such as Ubuntu®, Red Hat®, and CentOS hosts — NetQ captures network data and other state information in real time, providing cloud architects and network operations teams the ability to operate with visibility into the entire network. It is integrated with container orchestrators and the Netlink interface to make this happen. With NetQ, network operations changes from a manual, reactive, box-by-box approach to an automated, informed and agile one.

The system uses a three-pronged approach to validating networks:

- Preventative Validation: NetQ easily validates potential network configuration changes in a virtualized environment or lab using check, show and trace algorithms. NetQ eliminates the need to check switches or servers one by one and can reduce manual errors before they are rolled into production (one of the main causes of network downtime).
- Proactive Alerting: NetQ detects faulty network states that can result in packet loss or connectivity issues, and alerts the user with precise fault location data for faster remediation, greatly improving network agility and reducing downtime costs.
- Diagnostic Troubleshooting: NetQ provides the ability to trace network paths, replay the network state at a time in the past, review fabric-wide event change logs, and diagnose the root cause of state deviations.

NetQ also offers Image and Provisioning Management (IPM), which makes it possible to get your new Cumulus Linux switches up and running quickly by providing bootstrapping and lifecycle management capabilities, including image and ZTP configuration management. IPM contains local storage and distribution services for the Cumulus Linux network operating system (NOS) and provisioning scripts used to deploy and upgrade Cumulus Linux and NetQ. With IPM, network deployment changes from a tedious box-by-box installation process to a consistent and predictable one.
